    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong> Yvonne Wambui Muthui.</strong> </p>
        <p>If I were to choose an image to describe myself it would be :</p>
        <div id="line">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="/Images/eagle.jpg" alt="eagle">
                <p class="info">An Eagle</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p>Eagles are known to have powerful vision, they maintain and monitor there surroundings and they also fly very high. I use this image to represent myself because I like challenges in life and overcoming them and I have a great vision for myself in the future that i cannot wait to archieve. </p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I finished my high-school last year, 2021 in a school known as Shah Lalji Nangpar Academy. I have studied there from nursery to junior school then high school which included my A levels (two extra years to help further in my major). I heard about coding and I decided to give it a try and fell in love with it. My dream is to continue soaring high to achieve the highest level as a software engineer.</p>
