    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong> Yvonne Wambui Muthui.</strong> </p>
        <p>If I were to choose an image to describe myself it would have to be this:</p>
        <div id="line">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="/Images/eagle.jpg" alt="eagle">
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p>An Eagle. Eagles are known to have powerful vision, they maintain and monitor there surronding before making and they also fly very high. I use this image to represent myself because I like challenges in life and overcoming them and I have a great vision for myself in the future that i cannot wait to archieve. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I have created a few projects. From the past which is before I joined Moringa School I had accomplished to create this <a href="https://github.com/Yvonne-1-2-3/Pleo-CSS">Pleo</a> which includes HTML and CSS and once joined I created this <a href="https://github.com/Wambui-123/Tech">Technology</a> , which also includes HTML and CSS but I managed to edit my readme and was able to fork.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I finished my high-school last year in a school known as Shah Lalji Nangpar Academy. I have studied there from nusery to junior school then high school which included my A levels (two extra years to help further in your major). I had pick Biology, Business and Chemistry because I had the intrest in medical terms. I had majourly performed well in my IT examinations than in the sciences funnily enough, so once I had about coding I decided to give it a try and fell in love with it.</p>
