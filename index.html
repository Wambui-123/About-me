    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Yvonne Wambui Muthui.</p>
        <p>If i were to choose an image to describe myself it would have to be this:</p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/Images/fighter.svg" alt="Fighter">
        </div>
        <p>The reason why i have choosen this is because I believe in myself and throughout all the challenges i face i do not tend to give up easily and thats the most amazing thing I love about myself.</p>
    
    <p>I have created a few projects. From the past which is before i joined Moringa School I had accomplished to create this <a href="https://github.com/Yvonne-1-2-3/Pleo-CSS">Pleo</a> which includes HTML and CSS and once joined I created this <a href="https://github.com/Wambui-123/Tech">Technology</a> , which also includes HTML and CSS but i managed to edit my readme and was able to fork.</p>
